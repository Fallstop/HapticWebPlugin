# Plugin Icon

A plugin icon is a graphical image that represents your plugin in user interfaces. The plugin icon is displayed in the Options+ and Loupedeck applications, as well as in the Logitech Marketplace.

Options+ supports both black and white backgrounds for icons. To ensure that the plugin icon displays correctly on different backgrounds, please follow these guidelines:

- Image resolution must be 256x256 px in PNG format.
- The actual icon graphic must fit within a 192x192 px area centered in the icon.
- The remaining area around the icon graphic must be transparent.

To add an icon for the plugin, add it to the plugin lplug4 package under the folder named "metadata":

- metadata/Icon256x256.png
