# Marketplace Approval Guidelines

The capitalized terms used in this document have the same meaning as those defined in the [Logitech Marketplace Developer Agreement](https://loupedeck.com/marketplace-developer-agreement/) .

## Approval Process

Every new Digital Product and all new Digital Product versions (also known as updates), are subject to a verification and approval process performed by and at the sole discretion of the Logitech Marketplace team.

All new Digital Products and their subsequent updates are reviewed according to Logitech's availability at the time the Digital Product or its update is uploaded using this [form](https://marketplace.logitech.com/contribute) , but Logitech doesn't guarantee the time frame for the review as it can take longer due to various factors.

Along with automated checks, we manually review each Digital Product and Digital Product update one-by-one, before it becomes publicly available on Logitech Marketplace or Loupedeck Martketplace. The Digital Product Developer will receive a notification as soon as the status of the review changes, or if there are any questions regarding the Digital Product or Digital Product update.

If you haven't heard from us within the next ten (10) working days after the Digital Product upload, please reach out to us at [marketplace@logitech.com](mailto:marketplace@logitech.com)

Logitech reserves the right to repeat the review of Digital Products and Digital Product updates from time to time and withdraw approval for a Digital Product or Digital Product update if new information on their conformity with the approval criteria comes to Logitech's attention after such a review.
